 * HappyAgentInboxPage — the queue of questions a Happy Agent's agents are waiting on, answered
 * in place. Pending questions come first in the order they were asked, so
 * working top to bottom unblocks the agent that has waited longest; answered
 * questions stay below as a record of what was decided.
 *
 * A waiting question is one block: the session that asked heads it and the
 * question it asked fills it, because the two are the same fact and reading
 * them as separate objects is what made this screen hard to scan. An answered
 * one keeps no container at all — it is a record, not work, so it is a line
 * with what was decided under it and a rule between it and the next.
 *
 * Colour is spent only where it distinguishes: green on a settled question,
 * and the ordinary danger tone when a send failed. Nothing else is coloured.
 *
 * It renders exactly what it is handed and reports each answer upward. It holds
 * no queue of its own, so an answered question leaves only when the owner says
 * the Happy Agent resolved it.
