# Animation provenance

## Where these came from

The original five files were copied from `happy-list` (the Happy Coder React
Native app), `sources/assets/animations/`, on 2 August 2026 — `sparkles.json`
first, the other four on the same day the vocabulary was widened.
`alien-monster.json` followed on 22 August 2026 from that directory's
`game.json`. Each is byte-identical to its source: none was re-exported,
re-drawn, re-timed, or otherwise modified. `cat-face.json`, `closed-lock.json`,
`confetti-ball.json`, `fox.json`, `hatching-chick.json`, `llama.json`,
`party.json`, and `unicorn.json` were supplied by the project owner on 22
August 2026. `disguised-face.json` was supplied by the project owner on 23
August 2026. Their upstream sources are not recorded in the files.

None embeds a raster asset and none references an external image, so a scene is
one JSON fetch and nothing else. Each is imported by URL, so a screen only
downloads the animation it actually shows.

The repository formatter is told to leave this directory's JSON alone
(`ignorePatterns` in `.oxfmtrc.json`); without that it pretty-prints the files to
several times their size and the hashes above stop matching, which is the whole
point of recording them.

- **Licence for the six Happy Coder files** MIT, `Copyright (c) 2024 Happy Coder
Contributors`. That is a
  different copyright line from this repository's own
  (`Copyright (c) 2026 Happy (2) Contributors`), so the MIT requirement to carry
  the notice does apply. The complete, unabridged notice sits next to the files
  it covers, in `LICENSE` in this directory.
- **Upstream of upstream** unknown. `happy-list` records no attribution for
  these files and the JSON carries no author metadata, so this note can only
  vouch for the copy: where the artwork originally came from before it entered
  that repository has not been established here.
- **Licence for `cat-face.json`, `closed-lock.json`, `confetti-ball.json`,
  `disguised-face.json`, `fox.json`, `hatching-chick.json`, `llama.json`,
  `party.json`, and `unicorn.json`** not recorded in the supplied files. Their
  upstream licensing has not been independently established here.

### Why they were not converted to `.lottie` containers

A `.lottie` is a zip around the same JSON. These gzip to 8–47 KB over the wire
already, so there is little left for the container to win, and it would cost a
build step, a binary blob in review, and a second thing to keep reproducible.
Plain JSON stays diffable and needs no tooling.

## What each one means

The complete source set is seventeen glossy 3D emoji: 👾 game, 🐱 cat face, 🔒
closed lock, 🎊 confetti ball, 🥸 disguised face, 🦊 fox, 🐣 hatching chick, 🦙
llama, 🦄 unicorn, 🦉 owl, 🎉 party, 🍿 popcorn, 🤖 robot, 🐌 snail, ✨ sparkles,
🗿 stone, 🪄 wand. Twelve carry a meaning Happy actually needs, and each is used
for that one meaning and nothing else:

- 👾 **alien monster** — _people and agents are together in one live session._
  Multiplayer is a shared working room, not a transcript handed around after
  the work is finished.
- 🔒 **closed lock** — _access is secured._ It is the settled state after a
  private boundary has been established, not a warning or an access error.
- 🎊 **confetti ball** — _one milestone has just completed._ It marks the
  specific completion rather than a group celebration.
- 🥸 **disguised face** — _this machine's identity is being defined._ It belongs
  to profile creation, where the person names the identity Happy Agent will use
  for authored work and messages.
- 🐣 **hatching chick** — _something new has been created._ It belongs to the
  first successful appearance of a new project, session, or document.
- 🦙 **llama** — _several models are being combined on one job._ One harness
  turns an unusual mix of Claude, Codex, Grok, or anything else into one
  coherent workflow.
- 🎉 **party** — _a group is celebrating a shared completion._ It is the social
  counterpart to the confetti ball's single milestone.
- 🤖 **robot** — _an agent is ready, and waiting to be told what to do._ The
  screen with no session open, and a conversation with nothing in it yet.
- 🐌 **snail** — _something is being read right now, and it is taking a moment._
  Every panel-wide wait, with no exceptions worth explaining: a session, a file,
  the documents list, the shared files, the inbox, the
  activity list, the calls list, provider usage. It is deliberately
  self-deprecating: a wait is a wait,
  and pretending otherwise while someone stares at a blank screen is worse.
- 🪄 **wand** — _the missing thing is one you can make right here._ Only beside
  a button that makes it: the first document, the first note. Where the same
  screen is composed without that button it drops back to a plain glyph, because
  the wand's whole claim is that the reader can act.
- 🦉 **owl** — _we are watching, and nothing has been found yet._ A search box
  nobody has typed in.
- ✨ **sparkles** — _the absence is the good outcome._ A caught-up inbox, an
  activity list with nothing unread, a quiet home.

Each animation ends on the pose it was drawn to return to — the robot facing
front, the owl upright and alert, the snail at rest, the wand mid-sparkle, the
sparkle cluster full — so the frame a scene stops and holds is a frame worth
holding. That is why no hand-picked "rest frame" index appears in the code: the
last frame is the picture.

### The five that are not used

- 🍿 **popcorn** would be a second way of saying "wait", competing with the
  snail on the same screens. One waiting picture, used consistently, is a
  vocabulary; two is decoration.
- 🗿 **stone** is a deadpan internet joke. Happy should not smirk at someone who
  found nothing.
- 🦄 **unicorn** duplicates the llama's model-mixing role without reading as
  clearly as a model reference.
- 🐱 **cat face** and 🦊 **fox** are mascots without distinct product-state
  meanings. They stay available as source candidates without entering the typed
  scene vocabulary as decoration.

### Where a scene is deliberately absent

Artwork is for a state a reader sits in, not for every blank rectangle:

- **Errors and destructive states** keep their plain glyph. An animation next to
  "Session unavailable" would be levity in the wrong place.
- **A search or filter that matched nothing** keeps its glyph. It is a miss, not
  a settled absence, and it re-renders on every keystroke — art that replayed
  each time would be noise.
- **Small inline placeholders and repeated rows** keep their glyph. A scene is
  128px of artwork and a worker player; dozens at once would be neither.
- **Screens whose two halves are both empty** get one scene, on the half where
  the reader can act — the notes list, not the note editor beside it.

See `LottieScene.tsx` for how a scene plays, rests, and replays.
