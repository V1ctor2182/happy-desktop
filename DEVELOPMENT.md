# Developing Happy Desktop

Everything here runs from the repository root unless a path says otherwise.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- Node.js 24 or newer
- pnpm 10.28.1 or newer (the repository pins `pnpm@10.28.1` via `packageManager`)

```sh
pnpm install
```

## The normal loop

```sh
pnpm dev
```

Starts the complete Electron development environment against your normal local
Rig daemon. It runs behind Portless in loopback mode by default, so it needs no
Wi-Fi and serves an `https://…localhost` URL.

Flags, combinable:

| Flag        | Effect                                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--debug`   | Starts main-process, renderer, and Rig inspectors and prints their URLs |
| `--lan`     | Portless LAN mode (`.local`), only for deliberate device testing        |
| `--profile` | Preloads the dormant React profiler (see Profiling below)               |

Set `HAPPY2_DEBUG_RENDERER_PORT` when a specific renderer CDP port is required.

Other entries:

```sh
pnpm dev:web      # the same renderer in an ordinary browser, via Portless
pnpm blueprint    # the happy-desktop-ui component blueprint
```

## Running against a Rig checkout

Both commands point the app at a specific Rig checkout instead of the global
`rig` on your PATH. They start that checkout's own isolated daemon (its
`pnpm dev daemon start`, under `<checkout>/.rig-dev/.happy`) so you always run
against what the checkout currently builds.

```sh
pnpm dev:custom-rig <path-to-rig-checkout> [--debug] [--lan] [--profile]
```

Electron against the checkout's daemon. Any daemon already running for that
checkout is stopped first, so a source change made since the last start is
never silently ignored. Stop it later with
`(cd <checkout> && pnpm dev daemon stop)`.

```sh
pnpm dev:web:custom-rig <path-to-rig-checkout> [--port <port>] [--keep-daemon]
```

The renderer in a normal browser at `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (default 5174),
reaching the daemon through the same-origin `/__happy2_local_rig` proxy — the
same Happy Agent HTTP, SSE, and terminal code paths as Electron, without an
Electron window. The checkout's daemon is stopped when the command exits unless
you pass `--keep-daemon`.

## First-run sandbox

```sh
pnpm dev:sandbox [--reset] [--no-rig] [--name=x]
```

Runs the desktop against a throwaway home directory so onboarding can be
replayed as often as needed without touching the Rig you actually work in.
`--reset` wipes the sandbox, `--no-rig` simulates a machine where Rig is not
installed, `--name=x` keeps several sandboxes apart.

## Profiling

```sh
pnpm dev --profile
```

Preloads the dormant React profiler; nothing is collected until you press
Start in Settings → Dev Tools. Artifacts from this flavor are labeled
`development/non-representative`.

For trustworthy timing, use the optimized profile build instead of the Vite
development server:

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-electron build:profile:optimized
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-electron start:profile:optimized
```

## Validation

```sh
pnpm check
```

Runs `format:check`, `lint`, `typecheck`, and `build` across the workspace.
The individual commands work standalone at the root too:

```sh
pnpm format       # write formatting everywhere
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test         # every package's suite — see the warning below
```

`pnpm test` includes the `happy-desktop-ui` and `happy-desktop-gym` rendering
suites, which drive real Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit and take many minutes.
Prefer targeting the package — or the single test file — you actually changed.

## Targeted package commands

Use `--dir` to run an available script for one package:

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-state test
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-app typecheck
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-electron lint
```

| Package                           | Responsibility                                         |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `packages/happy-desktop-state`    | Framework-independent product state and agent protocol |
| `packages/happy-desktop-ui`       | Reusable components and the component blueprint        |
| `packages/happy-desktop-app`      | Application composition and routing                    |
| `packages/happy-desktop-electron` | macOS Electron shell and local daemon boundary         |
| `packages/happy-desktop-web`      | Browser development entry                              |
| `packages/happy-desktop-gym`      | Rendering and desktop verification utilities           |

## Gym (advanced)

The gym exercises the packaged desktop outside the normal loop. Its Electron
workloads require the optimized profile build, which `gym:electron:run` makes
for you:

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-gym gym:electron:run      # build + smoke workloads
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-gym gym:electron:prepare  # prepare the smoke profile
pnpm --dir packages/happy-desktop-gym gym:electron:clean    # remove gym state
```

These are not part of everyday validation; reach for them only when measuring
or verifying the built desktop itself.

## Troubleshooting

**Portless was installed as a startup service.** Happy's development commands
do not use a persistent proxy service. Run `portless service uninstall` once.

**Switching between loopback and `--lan`.** Portless keeps one proxy running
with the previous mode. Stop it first; Portless prints the exact
`portless proxy stop` command when it matters.

**`Not a Rig checkout`.** The custom-rig commands verify the path by looking
for `packages/rig-dev/package.json` underneath it. Point them at the root of a
Rig repository checkout.

**`Rig daemon did not write its token`.** The checkout's daemon failed to
start; its token should appear at `<checkout>/.rig-dev/.happy/agent/token`.
Check the daemon output printed just above, and try
`(cd <checkout> && pnpm dev daemon stop)` before rerunning.
